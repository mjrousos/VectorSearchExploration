    "Whereas document vectors with TF-IDF or BM25 are sparse and high-dimensional, [SBERT (Sentence-BERT)](https://www.sbert.net/) is a dense and low-dimensional representation of text. SBERT is built on the BERT pre-trained transformer network, so unlike TF-IDF, SBERT preserves semantic meaning (so \"puppy\" and \"dog\" are similar when vectorized). TF-IDF and BM25 are purely token based. SBERT is a pre-trained model that converts text into a 768-dimensional vector. This notebook demonstrates how to use SBERT to compute the similarity between two texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike TF-IDF and BM25, SBERT uses a pre-trained model so we can't build it from scratch without any dependencies. Instead, we'll use the `sentence-transformers` library, which provides a simple interface to use SBERT. Sentence-transformers is built on top of the Hugging Face transformers."
